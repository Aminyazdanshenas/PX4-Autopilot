/**
 * 	Core Position-Control for MC.
 * 	This class contains P-controller for position and
 * 	PID-controller for velocity.
 * 	Inputs:
 * 		vehicle position/velocity/yaw
 * 		desired set-point position/velocity/thrust/yaw/yaw-speed
 * 		constraints that are stricter than global limits
 * 	Output
 * 		thrust vector and a yaw-setpoint
 *
 * 	If there is a position and a velocity set-point present, then
 * 	the velocity set-point is used as feed-forward. If feed-forward is
 * 	active, then the velocity component of the P-controller output has
 * 	priority over the feed-forward component.
 *
 * 	A setpoint that is NAN is considered as not set.
 * 	If there is a position/velocity- and thrust-setpoint present, then
 *  the thrust-setpoint is ommitted and recomputed from position-velocity-PID-loop.
